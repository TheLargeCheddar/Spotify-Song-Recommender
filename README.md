# Spotify-Song-Recommender

DATASET: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/spotgen-music-dataset/versions/122
Couldn't upload data set in this repo as its too large of a file, but it is required to be downloaded in the same directory for this app to function. 

The goal of this project was to
make a program that could take a sample of user liked songs, and then based off of those
songs, generate a list of similar songs that the user may also enjoy. This is a very common
feature among almost every modern music playing application, I myself found Spotifyâ€™s discover
weekly playlist, or just recommended songs in general to be very accurate and an inspiration for
me to want to recreate something similar to this.
