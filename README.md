# Spotify-Song-Recommender

The goal of this project was to
make a program that could take a sample of user liked songs, and then based off of those
songs, generate a list of similar songs that the user may also enjoy. This is a very common
feature among almost every modern music playing application, I myself found Spotifyâ€™s discover
weekly playlist, or just recommended songs in general to be very accurate and an inspiration for
me to want to recreate something similar to this.
